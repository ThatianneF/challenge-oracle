Cypress Introduction 

Setup terminal
- npm init -y
- npm install cypress
- npx cypress open

Comment:
- Custom commands were made to facilitate the reading of the code and good practice of clean code.

Bugs: 
- In the test automation it shows me that the fields have changed and are being validated, when it updates it says that it has not changed.

Improvements: 
- The elements, being: name, id, class etc, don't have a standardized name.
